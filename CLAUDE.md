# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is SpinPics, a Progressive Web Application (PWA) - a pure frontend application for creating customizable spinning wheel games using user-uploaded photos. The project has completed all development phases and is production-ready.

## Architecture & Technical Stack

### Core Architecture
- **Vite + TypeScript PWA**: Modern tooling with hot reload and type safety - no backend server
- **Data Storage Strategy**: 
  - LocalStorage for metadata (galleries, categories, photo references, settings)
  - IndexedDB for photo blob storage (performance and size handling)
- **Offline-First Design**: Full functionality without internet connection via service worker

### Planned Project Structure
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main app entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json           # PWA manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ sw.js                   # Service worker
â”œâ”€â”€ css/                    # Stylesheets organized by feature
â”œâ”€â”€ js/                     # JavaScript modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage.js         # LocalStorage + IndexedDB abstraction layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gallery.js         # Gallery CRUD operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wheel.js           # Spinning wheel logic and weighted algorithms
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ animation.js       # 60fps wheel animations
â””â”€â”€ assets/                # PWA icons and UI assets
```

### Key Data Models
- **Gallery**: Container with name, spin mode, categories, and photos
- **Category**: Named groups with hex colors for visual organization  
- **Photo**: Stored in IndexedDB with weighted chance values and category assignment
- **Spin Modes**: Static (unchanging probabilities) vs Consume (reducing chances after wins)

### Core Business Logic
- **Weighted Random Selection**: Probability-based photo selection using chance values
- **Session State Management**: Tracking consumed chances in "Consume" mode
- **Dynamic Wheel Generation**: Real-time segment creation based on photos and categories
